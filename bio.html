<p> Hello! My name is Brendan Fahey. I was born in 1997 and am currently 18 years old. I grew up in the town of Enfield, CT. My father is a lawyer and my mother is a teacher. I went to Catholic school for both Elementary School and High School. When I was younger I used to play baseball but now I've moved to just golf. In high school I was on the newspaper and the golf team. I was also the captain of the math team for two years. I've been in Boy Scouts since I was 6 and I earned the rank of Eagle Scout. I plan on majoring in both Computer 
Engineering and Computer Science at Tufts University, where I am currently a freshman.
